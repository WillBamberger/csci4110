HW1 notes

Run on PSC “Bridges-2” (see manual. Link in README)

Must run:
module load openblas
before compiling
If you compiled first then run “make clean” and make again

You will need to edit a build file and change:

march=znver3
to
march=x86-64
Or something even better, if possible

To run the job on bridges2:
sbatch -p RM ./job-blas

note: RM = regular memory partition, which is what we use

See running job:

squeue -u <userid>

Where userid is your PSC/Bridges userid
